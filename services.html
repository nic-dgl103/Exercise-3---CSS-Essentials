      <h1>Our Services</h1>
      <p>At Hairpins, we care about the environment and recognize the impact we all have on it. We are continually
        making strides to reduce where we can and have only aligned ourselves with companies and products we believe in.
        We are proud to be a CERTIFIED GREEN CIRCLE SALON and through that partnership are able to divert 95% of our
        salon
        waste from landfills. Get in touch if you have any questions or want to learn more about the programs and
        charities we are focusing our efforts on.</p>
